<h1>Abstract</h1>

This is an extract from the R6RS that documents its support for custom ports.
These provide a hook into the Scheme port system from below, allowing the
creation of binary and textual ports that behave exactly like file, string,
and bytevector ports, but whose basic operations are provided by user code.
It has been lightly edited to fit R7RS style.

<h1>Issues</h1>

None at present.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>When reading from (or writing to) files, devices, pipes, sockets,
or other sources (or sinks) of data, it's often useful or necessary
to include one or more transformations on the data.</p>

<p>All of these can be done at a level above Scheme ports, but with some
loss in convenience.  In particular, the high-level Scheme procedures
like <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>display</code>
only accept port arguments.  By making it possible to create custom ports
that accept a low-level read (write) operation, perform a transformation,
and pass it on to some other port, convenience is served.  It is also
straightforward to chain custom ports together
in order to create transformation pipelines.</p>

<p>Examples of such transformations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>compression and decompression</li>
<li>encryption and decryption</li>
<li>character encoding and decoding</li>
<li>concatenation of multiple input ports</li>
<li>broadcasting to multiple output ports simultaneously</li>
<li>input ports that echo their input to a specified output port</li>
<li>ports which read from or write to a port<br>
which is the value of a parameter at the time of the read or write</li>
<li>script transliteration</li>
<li>object serialization and deserialization</li>
<li>code obfuscation</li>
</ul>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<div align=left><code>(make-custom-binary-input-port <i>id</i> <i>read!</i></code>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i>)</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created binary input port whose byte source is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>read!</i> procedure.
<i>Id</i> is a string naming the new port,
provided for informational purposes only.
<i>Read!</i> is a procedure that behaves as specified
below; it will be called by operations that perform binary input.</p>
<p>
Each of the remaining arguments may be <code>#f</code>; if any of
those arguments is not <code>#f</code>, it is a procedure
that behaves as specified below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>(<i>read!</i> <i>bytevector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</code></p>
<p>
<i>Start</i> will be a non-negative exact integer,
<i>count</i> will be a positive exact integer,
and <i>bytevector</i> will be a bytevector whose length is at least
<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
The <i>read!</i> procedure obtains up to <i>count</i> bytes
from the byte source, and writes those bytes
into <i>bytevector</i> starting at index <i>start</i>.
The <i>read!</i> procedure returns an exact integer.  This
integer represents the number of bytes that it has read.
To indicate an end of file, the <i>read!</i>
procedure writes no bytes and returns 0.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p><code>(<i>get-position</i>)</code></p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure (if supplied) returns an exact
integer representing the current position of
the input port.  If not supplied, the custom port will not support
the <code>port-position</code> operation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p><code>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</code></p>
<p>
<i>Pos</i> will be a non-negative exact integer.
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure (if supplied) sets the
position of the input port to <i>pos</i>.  If not supplied, the custom
port will not support the <code>set-port-position!</code> operation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p><code>(<i>close</i>)</code></p>
<p>
The <i>close</i> procedure (if supplied) performs any actions
that are necessary when the input port is closed.
</p>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
The implementation must not check the return
values of <i>read!</i> and <i>get-position</i> except when it actually calls
them as part of an I/O operation requested by the program.  The
implementation is not required to check that these procedures
otherwise behave as described.  If they do not, however, the behavior
of the resulting port is unspecified.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<div align=left><code>(make-custom-textual-input-port <i>id</i> <i>read!</i></code>
<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i>)</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created textual input port whose character source is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>read!</i> procedure.
<i>Id</i> is a string naming the new port,
provided for informational purposes only.
<i>Read!</i> is a procedure that behaves as specified
below; it will be called by operations that perform textual input.</p>
<p>
Each of the remaining arguments may be <code>#f</code>; if any of
those arguments is not <code>#f</code>, it is a procedure and
that behaves as specified below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>(<i>read!</i> <i>string</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</code></p>
<p>
<i>Start</i> will be a non-negative exact integer,
<i>count</i> will be a positive exact integer,
and <i>string</i> will be a string whose length is at least
<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
The <i>read!</i> procedure obtains up to <i>count</i> characters
from the character source, and writes those characters
into <i>string</i> starting at index <i>start</i>.
The <i>read!</i> procedure returns an exact integer
representing the number of characters that it has written.
To indicate an end of file, the <i>read!</i>
procedure writes no bytes and returns 0.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p><code>(<i>get-position</i>)</code></p>
<p>
The <i>get-position</i> procedure (if supplied) returns a single
value.  The return value represents the current position of
the input port.  If not supplied, the custom port will not support
the <code>port-position</code> operation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p><code>(<i>set-position!</i> <i>pos</i>)</code></p>
<p>
The <i>set-position!</i> procedure (if supplied) sets the
position of the input port to <i>pos</i> if <i>pos</i> is the return
value of a call to <i>get-position</i>.  If not supplied, the custom
port will not support the <code>set-port-position!</code> operation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p><code>(<i>close</i>)</code></p>
<p>
The <i>close</i> procedure (if supplied) performs any actions
that are necessary when the input port is closed.
</p>
</ul><p></p>

The implementation must not check the return
values of <i>read!</i> and <i>get-position</i> except when it actually calls
them as part of an I/O operation requested by the program.  The
implementation is not required to check that these procedures
otherwise behave as described.  If they do not, however, the behavior
of the resulting port is unspecified.

<div align=left><code>(make-custom-binary-output-port <i>id</i></code>
<i>write!</i>&nbsp;<i>get-position</i>&nbsp;<i>set-position!</i>&nbsp;<i>close</i>)</code></div><p>
Returns a newly created binary output port whose byte sink is
an arbitrary algorithm represented by the <i>write!</i> procedure.
<i>Id</i> is a string naming the new port,
provided for informational purposes only.
<i>Write!</i> is a procedure that behaves as specified
below; it will be called by operations that perform binary output.</p>
<p>
Each of the remaining arguments may be <code>#f</code>; if any of
those arguments is not <code>#f</code>, it is a procedure and
that behaves as specified in the description of
<code>make-custom-binary-input-port</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>(<i>write!</i> <i>bytevector</i> <i>start</i> <i>count</i>)</code></p>
<p>
<i>Start</i> and <i>count</i> will be non-negative exact
integers,
and <i>bytevector</i> will be a bytevector whose length is at least
<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
The <i>write!</i> procedure writes up to <i>count</i> bytes
from <i>bytevector</i> starting at index <i>start</i> 
to the byte sink.
If <i>count</i> is 0, the <i>write!</i> procedure
passes an end-of-file object (or equivalent) to the byte sink.
In any case, the <i>write!</i> procedure returns the number of
bytes that it wrote, as an exact integer.
</p>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
The implementation must not check the return
values of <i>write!</i> except when it actually calls <i>write!</i> as part of
an I/O operation requested by the program.  The implementation is not
required to check that <i>write!</i> otherwise behaves as described.
If it does not, however, the behavior of the resulting port is
unspecified.

<p>
<i>Start</i> and <i>count</i> will be non-negative exact

<i>start</i>  +  <i>count</i>.
The <i>write!</i> procedure writes up to <i>count</i> characters
from <i>string</i> starting at index <i>start</i> 
to the character sink.

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>Every conforming R6RS implementation, including at least Chez, Guile, IronScheme,
Larceny, Racket, and Vicare, already provides these procedures
in the <code>(rnrs io ports)</code> library.
Therefore, no implementation is provided here, especially since 
a portable implementation is not possible.</p>

<p>This SRFI can trivially be implemented on top of the Chicken
procedures <code>make-input-port</code> and <code>make-output-port</code>
in the <code>(chicken ports)</code> library.
Chicken makes
makes no provisions for getting and setting positions on either its
built-in ports or custom ones.  It also does not
distinguish between textual and binary ports (as permitted by R7RS), and its strings
can store binary data; indeed, interpretation as characters
is up to a higher-level library such as the <code>utf8</code> egg.

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

This would have been much more difficult without the R6RS team,
who produced a good-enough (as opposed to perfect) design
that John was happy to adopt.  Thanks also to Mikel More,
who convinced him of the necessity of having a design.
