  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Many people find that large numbers are easier to read when
  the digits are broken into small groups. For example, the number
  <code>1582439</code> might be easier to read if written as
  <code>1 582 439</code>. This applies to source code as it does to
  other writing. We propose an extension of Scheme syntax to allow
  the underscore as a digit separator in numerical constants.</p>

  <h2 id="_rationale">Rationale</h2>
  <h3 id="_how_many_digits_per_group">How many digits per
  group</h3>
  <p>Western cultures tend to divide digits into groups of three.
  This convention is not universal. For example, in India people
  write numbers like <code>3 14 15 926</code> (read <em>three crore
  fourteen lakh fifteen thousand nine hundred and twenty-six</em>
  in Indian English).</p>
  <p>For simplicity and universality, we propose that digit groups
  of all sizes may be mixed freely when writing a number. It is
  permissible to have just one digit in a group, and groups in a
  number don’t need to be ordered by increasing or decreasing digit
  count.</p>
  <h3 id="_what_separator_character_to_use">What separator
  character to use</h3>
  <p>Human cultures and programming languages differ in what
  separator to use between groups.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The examples in this document so far have used a space.
      This is familiar to humans but not a good fit for most
      programming languages since whitespace has a prominent role
      as token separator. Scheme is no exception here.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The next natural alternative is to use a comma or a
      period. This is likely to cause confusion in an international
      community since countries that use a comma as the decimal
      separator are as numerous as those that use a period. More
      trouble comes from Scheme using the comma to splice things
      into a quasiquoted list: e.g. <code>`(1,2)</code> evaluates
      to <code>(1 2)</code>. Allowing commas in numbers would
      change splicing behavior in a confusing way.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>C++ uses an apostrophe which is somewhat exotic and may
      call to mind units of measure, e.g. feet and inches. Scheme
      also uses the apostrophe for quotation: e.g.
      <code>'(1'2)</code> evaluates to <code>(1 (quote 2))</code>.
      Allowing apostrophes in numbers would change the meaning of
      this syntax.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The most popular digit group separator among programming
      languages is the underscore. It is in the standard syntax of
      Ada, C#, Clojure, Eiffel, Frink, Java, Julia, Kotlin, OCaml,
      Perl, Python, Ruby, Rust and Swift. It is also being added to
      JavaScript and is a common syntax extension in
      implementations of Standard ML. The Common Lisp standard
      permits it under the umbrella of <em>potential numbers</em>
      but we are not aware of implementations that use the
      opportunity. Of Scheme implementations, Gauche can read
      numbers with underscores when they have a radix or exactness
      prefix.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In light of the above, we consider the underscore to be the
  clear winner. It is the most widely compatible and least
  ambiguous choice, in both human and machine terms.</p>
  <h3 id="_potential_ambiguity_between_numbers_and_identifiers">
  Potential ambiguity between numbers and identifiers</h3>
  <p>Languages in the Lisp family traditionally allow a larger set
  of characters in identifiers than do most other languages. For
  example, the tokens <code>1+</code> and <code>3*/!</code> parse
  as symbols in Common Lisp. Scheme is slightly more restrictive:
  none of R<sup>4</sup>RS, R<sup>5</sup>RS, R<sup>6</sup>RS and
  R<sup>7</sup>RS recognize identifiers that begin with a decimal
  digit. Implementations can be more relaxed with identifiers. For
  example, MIT Scheme comes with <code>1+</code> and
  <code>-1+</code> procedures to increment and decrement numbers.
  Several implementations presently parse tokens consisting
  entirely of digits and underscores as identifiers. Some
  implementations, such as Chicken, assume that anything they
  cannot recognize as a number is an identifier.</p>
  <p>Countless languages outside the Lisp family have a convention
  of using underscores as word separators in multi-word
  identifiers. Following that convention, Scheme’s
  <code>open-input-file</code> would be spelled
  <code>open_input_file</code> instead. In these languages it’s
  common to use a leading underscore to mark private (as opposed to
  public or exported) identifiers. This leads to potential
  ambiguity with identifiers such as <code>_123</code> that start
  with an underscore and contain only underscores and digits. Such
  tokens often parse as identifiers. If we made them parse as
  numbers in Scheme it could confuse programmers and spell trouble
  for code generators that translate Scheme identifiers to other
  languages.</p>
  <p>Scheme supports a rich numeric tower of integers, ratios, real
  and complex numbers. These come in exact and inexact varieties.
  For real numbers, we have decimal-point and exponent notation.
  The Kawa implementation of Scheme adds quaternions and units of
  measure to the mix. Common Lisp’s <em>potential numbers</em>
  offer a glimpse of how far numerical syntax can go. These
  intricate extensions, some of which we cannot even anticipate
  yet, make it even trickier for us to specify a digit separation
  scheme devoid of ambiguity.</p>
  <p>We attempt to solve these problems with a conservative rule
  that allows underscores only <em>between</em> digits. After
  considering everything in the above paragraphs, we did not manage
  to come up with any concrete examples of present or future tasks
  that would be impeded by this restricted version of the syntax
  extension.</p>
  <p>As an extra measure we also forbid trailing underscores, and
  forbid more than one consecutive underscore. We could not think
  of any particular situations these cause problems but decided to
  avoid them anyway. There are enough similar gotchas that caution
  seems the wise choice.</p>
  <h3 id="_printing_numbers_with_underscores">Printing numbers with
  underscores</h3>
  <p>This SRFI does not specify anything about inserting
  underscores into numbers at print time. Printing with underscores
  would be as useful as reading is, especially when using a Scheme
  <em>read-eval-print loop</em> as a calculator. However, there is
  no consensus on how to best extend the Scheme printer. Major work
  is underway but it will not stabilize in time for the publication
  of this SRFI.</p>
  <p>Apart from printer extension concerns the cultural conventions
  of where to place digit separators are also varied and complex.
  When reading numbers we can leave the decision to writers and
  simply accept a wide range of possibilities. When printing we
  would have to make those decisions, or else map out what printer
  options are needed and design good defaults for them.</p>
  <p>For these reasons, decisions about printing are deferred to
  implementations and to future SRFIs.</p>
  <h2 id="_specification">Specification</h2>
  <h3 id="_the_underscore_rule">The underscore rule</h3>
  <p>We stipulate that conforming implementations of this SRFI must
  <em>allow one underscore between any two digits, in any part of a
  number</em>.</p>
  <p>For the purpose of this rule, the term <em>digit</em> covers
  all digits in any radix between 2 and 36 inclusive - not only
  decimal digits. That means that the letters <code>a-z</code> and
  <code>A-Z</code> are considered digits (but only in places where
  the implementation parses that character as a digit).</p>
  <h3 id="_the_rule_is_necessarily_ambiguous_and_incomplete">The
  rule is necessarily ambiguous and incomplete</h3>
  <p>We lament that it is impossible to give a precise formal
  definition of the underscore rule because a typical Scheme
  implementation does not have a complete formal grammar for its
  syntax. Even if it did, that grammar could change in new
  versions.</p>
  <p>The next section gives what we believe to be a correct and
  complete extension to the formal grammar of standard Scheme. But
  since few implementations support the whole standard syntax and
  nothing but the standard syntax, implementors of this SRFI may
  encounter situations where their subjective judgment is called
  for. The subsequent section attempts to help by listing many
  examples of how the rule is intended to apply in particular
  situations. Unfortunately that list cannot be exhaustive
  either.</p>
  <p>In situations where the letter of this specification does not
  say anything conclusive, we ask that implementors try to follow
  its spirit. When in doubt as to whether or not underscores should
  be supported in a particular part of number syntax, we suggest
  that implementors <em>not</em> allow them. They can always be
  allowed later once there is more clarity or consensus.</p>
  <h3 id="_the_rule_as_applied_to_r">The rule as applied to
  R<sup>n</sup>RS</h3>
  <p>The standard syntax of Scheme is defined in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>R<sup>6</sup>RS section <em>4.2. Lexical syntax</em></li>
    <li>R<sup>7</sup>RS section <em>7.1. Formal syntax</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The underscore rule can be implemented as an extension to
  either standard by adding the following grammar rules to the
  lexical syntax:</p>
  <pre>
⟨digits R⟩       = ⟨digit R⟩+ ⟨more digits R⟩
⟨more digits R⟩  = ⟨empty⟩ | ⟨one underscore⟩ ⟨digits R⟩
⟨maybe digits R⟩ = ⟨empty⟩ | ⟨digits R⟩
⟨one underscore⟩ = _</pre>
  <p>and then making the following substitutions in existing rules
  (for all <code>R</code>):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>replace all occurrences of <code>⟨digit R⟩+</code> with
    <code>⟨digits R⟩</code></li>
    <li>replace all occurrences of <code>⟨digit R⟩*</code> with
    <code>⟨maybe digits R⟩</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that both standards also define the character classes
  <code>⟨digit⟩</code> and <code>⟨hex digit⟩</code>. Neither of
  those should be amended. The <code>⟨digit⟩</code> class is used
  for identifiers and to help define other character classes. The
  <code>⟨hex digit⟩</code> class is used to define the backslash
  escape syntax for inserting characters into strings by their
  hexadecimal value. This SRFI does not modify the syntax of string
  escapes, and does not aim to modify the syntax of
  identifiers.</p>
  <h3 id="_implications_of_the_rule">Implications of the rule</h3>
  <p>The rule <em>includes</em> at least the following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores between digits in numbers of any radix
      (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal and any others supported
      by the implementation).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores between digits <code>0-9 a-z A-Z</code> when a
      number is written in a radix higher than 10 (using the
      standard hexadecimal read syntax, or any
      implementation-defined read syntax).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores in the numerator and/or denominator of a
      ratio.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores in the integer, fractional and/or exponent
      part of a real number.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores in the real and/or imaginary part of a complex
      number.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores in any dimension of a hypercomplex number (for
      implementations with syntax for such numbers).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores in both exact and inexact numbers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores in the quantity part of a number with a unit
      of measure (for implementations with syntax for units of
      measure).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores between leading zeros (but not before the
      first zero).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The rule <em>excludes</em> at least the following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Leading underscores before digits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Trailing underscores after digits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Two or more consecutive underscores.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores between sign and magnitude.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores next to a letter in a prefix. This includes
      the <code>#b #o #d #x</code> radix prefixes, the <code>#e
      #i</code> exactness prefixes and the
      <code>#</code><em>n</em><code>r</code> arbitrary radix prefix
      of Chez Scheme.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores next to <code>#</code> unknown digit markers
      in inexact numbers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores next to the <code>d D e E f F l L s S</code>
      exponent markers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores next to the <code>@ + - i j k</code> markers
      in complex and hypercomplex numbers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores next to the R<sup>6</sup>RS <code>|</code>
      mantissa width suffix.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Underscores next to and within the <code>inf</code> and
      <code>nan</code> markers.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="_being_lenient_about_the_rule">Being lenient about the
  rule</h3>
  <p>Conforming implementations <em>may</em> be more lenient in
  what they allow (perhaps to maintain compatibility with existing
  code). In this document, numbers written according to the
  underscore rule are called <em>conforming</em>. Other numbers
  (which may or may not be valid depending on the implementation)
  are called <em>non-conforming</em>.</p>

  <h2 id="_implementation">Implementation</h2>
  <p>The sample implementation is a portable library that depends
  only on standard features in the R<sup>7</sup>RS small language.
  It is available at:</p>
  <p><a class="eponymous" href=
  "https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-169">github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-169</a></p>
  <p>The library exports one procedure <code>(read-number)</code>
  which takes no arguments. The procedure reads one Scheme number
  from <code>current-input-port</code> with support for optional
  underscores. It signals an error if underscores are used in a
  non-conforming way according to the rule stipulated in this SRFI,
  or if the number syntax (sans underscores) does not conform to
  the R<sup>7</sup>RS specification. The reader supports most of
  the R<sup>7</sup>RS numeric tower with the notable exception of
  complex numbers. The values of inexact numbers may diverge from
  the values produced by the native reader of a Scheme
  implementation if it uses different formulas for numeric
  conversion.</p>
  <p>The code was tested against the examples in this SRFI. Correct
  results were obtained with Chibi-Scheme, Gauche and Kawa. The
  test harness is included with the implementation.</p>
  <h2 id="_acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>This SRFI is the result of an impromptu design session on the
  <code>srfi-discuss</code> mailing list over the weekend between
  April 12th and April 15th, 2019.</p>
  <p>Lassi Kortela suggested the idea, worked out the examples and
  rationale, wrote this document and produced the sample
  implementation. However the design is entirely a group
  effort.</p>
  <p>John Cowan provided invaluable expertise on human and computer
  languages. He cautioned against requiring a fixed number of
  digits per group and provided the Indian English example. John
  found the extensive list of programming languages already using
  underscores. John and Lassi cautioned against the ambiguity of
  using commas as delimiters.</p>
  <p>Per Bothner introduced Kawa's extended number syntax and noted
  Common Lisp's <em>potential numbers</em> as prior art. Per and
  John made sure the underscore syntax works when units of measure
  are supported, considering prior art from Kawa's syntax and the
  JavaScript community. Per explained Kawa's syntax for quaternions
  which led to hypercomplex numbers being supported.</p>
  <p>Shiro Kawai explained the approach of Gauche which can already
  skip underscores when reading <code>#</code>-prefixed numbers. He
  suggested extending Scheme's formal grammar.</p>
  <p>Peter Bex cautioned against over-extending Scheme's already
  intricate number syntax and potentially breaking
  backward-compatibility for some programs. John and Lassi
  advocated forbidding leading, trailing and repeated underscores
  as a reasonable precaution. Arthur Gleckler suggested a dedicated
  <code>#_</code> prefix and a user interface feature for text
  editors as two failsafe alternatives.</p>
  <p>Shiro, Peter and John reminded us that identifiers starting
  with digits are forbidden in Scheme standards since
  R<sup>4</sup>RS. But Jim Rees, Arthur and John brought up
  <em>peculiar identifiers</em> which let implementations break
  that rule.</p>
  <p>Hugo Hörnquist had the idea of using Scheme's
  <code>display</code> procedure to print numbers with underscores,
  reserving <code>write</code> for portable syntax. John advised
  that we postpone any decisions about printing, pointing to Alex
  Shinn's SRFI 159 and SRFI 166 as potential solutions with a view
  to the upcoming large edition of the R<sup>7</sup>RS
  standard.</p>
