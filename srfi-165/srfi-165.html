    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    Monads model computations.  The environment monad models
    computations that depend on values from a shared environment.
    These computations can read values from the environment, pass
    values to subsequent computations, execute sub-computations in an
    extended environment, and modify the environment for future
    computations.

    <h1>Rationale</h1>

    <p>The environment monad is useful whenever code has to be
      suspended and executed at a later time (even several times), and
      whenever code depends (implicitly) on bindings of variables in a
      shared environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      SRFI 166, a forthcoming revision of the combinator formatting
      SRFI 159, is a major use case of the environment monad and a
      good example of the concept in practice.  The formatters in SRFI
      166 are computations in the nomenclature of this SRFI.  In
      particular, the properties for computations apply to formatters
      as well and the primitive and the derived procedures of this
      SRFI can be used to construct sophisticated formatters of SRFI
      166.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nonetheless, SRFI 165 is an independent SRFI and not a proper
      part of SRFI 166 for two reasons: Firstly, SRFI 166's
      combinator formatters are just one use case for the environment
      monad of SRFI 165, so one wants to be able to use the procedures
      and syntax specified in this SRFI independently of
      formatting. Secondly, this SRFI exports more primitive and
      derived procedures for the environment monad and computations
      than are usually needed to write simple SRFI 166 formatters, so
      including them all in SRFI 166 would shift away the focus
      of SRFI 166 too much from its genuine purpose, formatting.
    </p>

    <h2>Monads</h2>

    <p>
      In category theory, a <em>monad</em> on a category <var>C</var>
      is nothing but a monoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors
      [<var>C</var>, <var>C</var>] over <var>C</var>.  This rather
      abstract notion has become a well-understood design pattern in
      functional programming, having been popularized notably by the
      lazy functional programming language Haskell.
    </p>

    <p>
      As there are already many good explanations for monads in
      computer science, and as understanding the mathematical concept
      in detail is not necessary to work with this SRFI, we refrain
      from repeating the theoretical foundations.  We just want to
      remark that the
      <em>environment monad</em> considered here is roughly a monad on
      the category whose objects are natural numbers <var>n</var> and whose
      morphisms <var>m</var> → <var>n</var> are Scheme procedures
      taking <var>m</var> values and returning <var>n</var> values.
      Moreover, what is called the environment monad here and
      elsewhere is called the <em>Reader</em> monad in Haskell.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI introduces two new concepts, <dfn>environments</dfn>
      and <dfn>computations</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computations are the monadic values of the environment monad
      described in this SRFI.
    </p>

    <h2>Computations</h2>

    <p>
      A computation can be thought of as suspended code much like
      promises but with the difference that a computation can
      be <dfn>executed</dfn> more than once and that its results are not
      cached.
    </p>

    <p>
      When executed, a computation yields <dfn>results</dfn>, which
      can be arbitrary Scheme values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest computation
      is <code>(computation-pure <var>val<sub>1</sub> …)</code>,
      which just yields the results <var>val<sub>1</sub></var> …
      when executed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI provides a number of combinators that combine
      computations.  For
      example <code>(computation-each <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>
      … <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var>)</code> is the computation
      formed by applying each <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>,
      …, <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var> in sequence and eventually
      yielding the results of the last one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another combinator known from monads in functional programming
      is the computation
      <code>(computation-bind <var>computation</var> <var>proc</var>)</code>,
      which is the computation formed by feeding the results yielded
      by <var>computation</var> to <var>proc</var> and yielding the
      results of the computation returned by the invocation
      of <var>proc</var>.
    </p>

    <p>Computations are executed by <code>computation-run</code>.  The
      expression <code>(computation-run <var>computation</var>)</code>
      returns the values yielded by the execution
      of <var>computation</var>.
    </p>

    <p>The primary constructor for computations
      is <code>make-computation</code>.  For example,
    </p>
    <pre>(make-computation
  (lambda (compute)
    (if (compute a) 42 (compute b)))</pre>
    <p>
      returns a computation that, when executed, first
      computes <code>a</code>.  If that computation yields a true
      value, <code>42</code> is yielded, otherwise the result of
      computing <code>b</code> is yielded.
    </p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>

    <p>
      The computations of the environment monad are executed on
      an <dfn>environment</dfn>.  <dfn>Environment variables</dfn> can
      be bound to values in these environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fresh environment variables are created by invoking the
      procedure <code>make-computation-environment-variable</code>.
      Each environment variable has a default value.
    </p>

    <p>Environments can be extended non-destructively to new
      environments or can be modified in place (for subsequent
      computations).
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>computation-run</code> procedure creates a new empty environment
      that is then threaded through the computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI provides the
      computation <code>(computation-ask)</code>, which yields the
      current environment.  Executing the
      computation <code>(computation-local <var>updater</var> <var>computation</var>)</code>
      on an environment <var>env</var> means
      executing <var>computation</var> on the
      environment <code>(<var>updater</var> env)</code>.
    </p>

    <h1>Specification</h1>

    <h2>Environment procedures</h2>

    <p><code>(make-computation-environment-variable <var>name</var> <var>default</var>
	<var>immutable?</var>)</code></p>

    <p>Returns a Scheme object that can be used as an <dfn>environment
      variable</dfn>, whose default value is <var>default</var> and
      which is immutable if <var>immutable?</var> is
      not <code>#f</code>.  The symbol or string <var>name</var> is
      solely for debugging purposes.  The type of the returned object
      is unspecified.  Each invocation returns an environment variable
      different to any previously returned environment variable.
    </p>

    <p><code>(make-computation-environment)</code></p>

    <p>Returns a new <dfn>environment</dfn>, in which environment
      variables can be bound to values.  The type of the returned
      object is unspecified.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-environment-ref <var>env</var> <var>var</var>)</code></p>

    <p>If the variable <var>var</var> is bound to a value in the
    environment <var>env</var>, returns that value,
    and the environment variable's default value otherwise.</p>

    <p><code>(computation-environment-update <var>env</var> <var>arg</var>
	…)</code></p>
    
    <p>
      The arguments <var>arg</var> … alternate between environment
      variables <var>var</var> and values <var>val</var>.
      Returns a new environment that extends the
      environment <var>env</var> by binding each
      environment variable <var>var</var>
      to the respective value <var>val</var>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-environment-update! <var>env</var> <var>var</var> <var>val</var>)</code></p>

    <p>Updates the environment <var>env</var> in place by
      binding the environment variable <var>var</var>
      to <var>val</var>, and returns an unspecified value.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-environment-copy <var>env</var>)</code></p>

    <p>Returns a fresh copy of the
      environment <var>env</var>.
    </p>

    <h2>Primitive monadic procedures</h2>

    <p><code>(make-computation <var>proc</var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Takes a procedure <var>proc</var>, which takes one argument, and
      returns a <dfn>computation</dfn>.  The Scheme type of a
      computation is disjoint from any type, as if created by
      <code>define-record-type</code>, except possibly procedures.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the computation is later <dfn>executed</dfn> on an
      environment, the procedure <var>proc</var> is called with an
      argument <var>compute</var>, which is a procedure taking one
      argument.  Whenever <var>compute</var> is invoked on another
      computation, the other computation is executed on the
      environment and its results are returned.
      The <dfn>results</dfn> yielded by the execution are the results
      of the invocation of <var>proc</var>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-run <var>computation</var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Executes the computation <var>computation</var> and returns the
      results it yields.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-ask)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns a computation that, when executed on an environment,
      yields that environment.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-local <var>updater</var> <var>computation</var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns a computation that, when executed on an
      environment <var>env</var>, invokes the
      procedure <var>updater</var> on <var>env</var>, executes the
      computation <var>computation</var> on the result of the
      invocation of <var>updater</var>, which must be an environment,
      and yields its results.
    </p>

    <h2>Derived monadic procedures</h2>

    <p><code>(computation-pure <var>obj<sub>1</sub></var> …)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns a computation that, when executed, yields the
      values <var>obj<sub>1</sub></var> ….
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-each <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>
	… <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns a computation that, when executed, sequentially executes
      the computations <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>,
      …, <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var> and yields the results
      yielded by the last computation.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-each-in-list <var>list</var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Equivalent to <code>(computation-each <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>
	… <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var>)</code>
	if <var>list</var> is a list whose elements
	are <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>,
	…, <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-bind <var>computation</var> <var>proc<sub>1</sub></var> …)</code></p>

    <p>
      <code>(computation-bind <var>computation</var>)</code> is equivalent
      to <var>computation</var>.  <code>(computation-bind <var>computation</var>
	<var>proc<sub>1</sub></var> <var>proc<sub>2</sub></var>
	…)</code> is equivalent to <code>(computation-bind
	(computation-bind <var>computation</var> <var>proc<sub>1</sub></var>)
	<var>proc<sub>2</sub></var> …)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The invocation of <code>(computation-bind <var>computation</var> <var>proc</var>)</code>
      returns a computation that, when executed, executes the
      computation <var>computation</var>, on which results the
      procedure <var>proc</var> is then invoked, resulting in
      a computation that is then executed and whose results are yielded.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>(computation-sequence <var>list</var>)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      When invoked on a list <var>list</var> of computations, returns
      a computation that, when executed, executes the computations in
      sequence and yields a list whose elements are the results
      yielded by the computations.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-forked <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>
	… <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns a computation that, when executed on an environment,
      executes each of the
      computations <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>, … on fresh
      copies of the environment, and finally
      executes <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var> on the original
      environment and yields its results.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-bind/forked <var>computation</var> <var>proc<sub>1</sub></var> …)</code></p>

    <p>
      As <code>(computation-bind <var>computation</var> <var>proc<sub>1</sub></var>
      …)</code>, but executes <var>computation</var> on a fresh copy
      of the environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Derived syntax</h2>

    <p><code>(computation-fn ((〈variable<sub>1</sub>〉 〈init<sub>1</sub>〉) …) 〈body〉)</code></p>

    <p>
      Evaluates the expressions 〈init<sub>1</sub>〉 … to environment
      variables <var>var<sub>1</sub></var> … in an unspecified order and
      returns a computation that, when executed, lexically binds the
      variables 〈variable<sub>1</sub>〉 … to the values to which the
      environment variables <var>var<sub>1</sub></var>, … are bound,
      and evaluates the body <code>〈body〉</code> in the resulting lexical environment.
      The value of the last expression in <code>〈body〉</code> has to be a computation,
      which is then executed and its results yielded.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <dfn>clause</dfn> of the form <code>(〈variable〉 〈variable〉)</code>
      (i.e. the <code>expression 〈init〉</code>
      is the variable reference <code>〈variable〉</code>) can be
      abbreviated by <code>〈variable〉</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      An unbound environment variable behaves as if it were bound
      to its default value.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-with ((〈variable<sub>1</sub>〉 〈init<sub>1</sub>〉) …) 〈expr<sub>1</sub>〉 …
	〈expr<sub>n</sub>〉)</code></p>
    <p>
      Evaluates the expressions 〈expr<sub>1</sub>〉 …
      〈expr<sub>n</sub>〉 to
      computations <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>,
      …, <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var>, the expressions
      〈variable<sub>1</sub>〉 … to environment
      variables <var>var<sub>1</sub></var> … and the expressions
      〈init<sub>1</sub>〉 … to values <var>val<sub>1</sub></var> … in
      an unspecified order, and returns a computation that, when
      executed on an environment, extends that environment
      non-destructively by binding <var>var<sub>1</sub></var>, …
      to <var>val<sub>1</sub> …</var>, sequentially executes
      the computations <var>computation<sub>1</sub></var>,
      … <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var> on that extended
      environment, and then yields the results of the last computation.
    </p>

    <p><code>(computation-with! (〈variable<sub>1</sub>〉 〈init<sub>1</sub>〉) …)</code></p>

    <p>
      Evaluates the expressions 〈variable<sub>1</sub>〉 … to mutable
      environment variables <var>var<sub>1</sub></var> … and the
      expressions 〈init<sub>1</sub>〉 … to
      values <var>val<sub>1</sub></var> … in an unspecified order, and
      returns a computation that, when executed on an environment,
      modifies this environment in place by
      binding <var>var<sub>1</sub></var>, … to <var>val<sub>1</sub>
      …</var> and which yields an unspecified value.
    </p>

    <h2>Environment variables</h2>

    <p><code>default-computation</code></p>
    
    <p>This SRFI exports the
      identifier <code>default-computation</code>, which is bound to a
      location holding a mutable environment variable (as if created
      by <code>(make-computation-environment-variable)</code>) in the
      sense of this SRFI.  In each fresh computation
      environment, <code>default-computation</code> is initially
      unbound.  Whenever a computation <var>computation</var> is to be
      executed on an environment and is neither a computation nor a
      procedure, the value to which <code>default-computation</code>
      is bound in the environment has to be a procedure, which is then
      invoked on <var>computation</var> to return a computation, which
      is then executed on the environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Extension for predefined environment variables</h2>

    <p>
      The complexity for accessing environment variables is
      O(<var>n</var>) where <var>n</var> is the number of variables
      bound in the environment.
    </p>

    <p>In use cases where a few environment variables are accessed
      often and can be defined statically, the following syntax
      can be used, which guarantees an access time of O(1) for
      predefined environment variables.
    <p>

    <p><code>(define-computation-type 〈make-environment〉 〈run〉 〈clause〉 …)</code></p>

    <p>This syntax may appear wherever other definitions may
      appear. Each <code>〈clause〉</code> is of the form <code>(〈variable〉 〈default〉)</code>,
      <code>(〈variable〉 〈default〉 "immutable")</code>,
      or <code>〈variable〉</code>.  The latter form is equivalent
      to <code>(〈variable〉 #f)</code>.
      <code>〈make-environment〉</code>, <code>〈run〉</code>,
      and each <code>〈variable〉</code> are identifiers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      An instance of <code>define-computation-type</code> is equivalent
      to the following definitions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p><code>〈make-environment〉</code> is bound to a procedure that takes no
	  arguments.  Invoking the procedure is equivalent to
	  invoking <code>make-computation-environment</code> except
	  that the environment variables defined below can be used with
	  the resulting environment.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><code>〈run〉</code> is bound to a procedure that takes one argument.
	  Invoking the procedure is equivalent to
	  invoking <code>computation-run</code> except for that the
	  initial environment is created by invoking the procedure bound
	  to <code>〈make-environment〉</code>.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Each <code>〈variable〉</code> is bound to an environment
	  variable, which can only be used with an environment created
	  by invoking the procedure bound
	  to <code>〈make-environment〉</code>.  Its default value is
	  the result of evaluating <code>〈default〉</code>.  The
	  environment variable is immutable if the <code>(〈variable〉
	  〈default〉 "immutable")</code> form is used.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-local control flow</h2>

    <p>The (higher order) procedures described in this SRFI are fully
      compatible with non-local control flow, in particular with
      first-class continuations.</p>

    <p>For example, the behavior is well-defined if the
      argument <var>proc</var> of <code>make-computation</code>
      returns multiple times.
    </p>

    <h2>Proper tail recursion</h2>

    <p>Computations can be executed in <dfn>tail context</dfn>.  A
    tail context is always determined with respect to a particular
    call to <code>computation-run</code>.</p>

    <p>The following rules apply inductively:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If <code>computation-run</code> is invoked, its
	  argument <var>computation</var> is executed in tail context
	  with respect to that call.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If the computation returned by <code>make-computation</code>
	  is executed in tail context, the argument <var>proc</var> is
	  tail-called with respect to the call
	  to <code>computation-run</code>.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If the computation returned by <code>computation-local</code>
	  is executed in tail context, its argument <var>computation</var> 
	  is executed in tail context.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If the computation returned by <code>computation-each</code>
	  is executed in tail context, its
	  argument <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var>
	  is executed in tail context.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If the computation returned by <code>computation-bind</code>
	  is executed in tail context, the computation returned by its
	  argument <var>proc</var> is executed in tail context.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If the computation returned by <code>computation-forked</code>
	  is executed in tail context, its
	  argument <var>computation<sub>n</sub></var> is executed in
	  tail context.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If the computation returned by <code>computation-fn</code> is
	  executed in tail context, the last expression
	  in <code>〈body〉</code> is executed in tail context.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>

    <h2>Relation to other SRFIs</h2>

    <p>
      In a Scheme system that supports both SRFI 165 and SRFI 166, the
      implementation of SRFI 166 shall be compatible with the
      implementation of SRFI 165.  This means, in particular, the
      following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>SRFI 166 formatters are SRFI 165 computations.  In
	  particular, they yield values (often an undefined one) to
	  support functional programming.  SRFI
	  166's <code>show</code> executes the computations in a SRFI
	  166-specific environment.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  The bindings of the
	  identifiers <code>fn</code>, <code>with</code>, <code>with!</code>,
	  <code>each</code>, <code>each-in-list</code>, <code>forked</code>,
	  and <code>make-state-variable</code> of SRFI 166 are the same
	  as the bindings
	  of <code>computation-fn</code>, <code>computation-with</code>,
	  <code>computation-with!</code>,
	  <code>computation-each</code>, <code>computation-each-in-list</code>,
	  <code>computation-forked</code>,
	  and <code>make-computation-environment-variable</code> of SRFI 165,
	  respectively.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Further details can be found in the upcoming SRFI 166.</p>

    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <p>The sample implementation is coded in portable R7RS scheme.  It
      makes use of the (portable) SRFI 1, SRFI 111, SRFI 125, SRFI
      128, and SRFI 146.  The testing code also uses SRFI 64.

    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

    <p>
      This SRFI has been inspired by the <code>(chibi monad
	environment)</code> library distributed by Alex Shinn's Chibi
	Scheme and by SRFI 159, also by Alex Shinn.
    </p>

    <p>
      The environment monad is called the <em>Reader</em> monad in Mark P. Jones'
      <i>Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order
Polymorphism</i>, Advanced School of Functional Programming, 1995.
    </p>

    <p>
      The notion of monads was invented by Roger Godement under the
      name <em>standard construction</em>.  They are also known
      as <em>triples</em>.  The term <em>monad</em> is due to Saunders
      Mac Lane.

      The author of this SRFI wants to thank Alex Shinn and John
      Cowan for their valuable comments during its draft period.
